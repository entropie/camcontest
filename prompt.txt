Analyze a sequence of N images of 1-3 dogs by comparing them chronologically. Your goal is to rate their collective activity on the non-linear scale below.

Scoring (1-10):

    1: All dogs are lying still.
    3: A dog changing positions or lying with head up
    5: Multiple (!) dogs changing positions 
    7: At least one dog is standing (this is a high-alert state).
    10: Dogs are actively moving or interacting.

Output (Strict):
Your response must be a single sentence starting exactly with Activity level [SCORE]. If the score is 7 or higher, add a very brief description.

Examples:
    Activity level 1
    Activity level 6: with the white dog standing
    Activity level 9: dogs are playing
