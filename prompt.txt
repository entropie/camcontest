carefully examine each of the 3 images from the sequence of a surviliance camera few second apart each other and find any dogs (usually there are at least 2 or 3 sometimes more) and evalute what they do and where they are located

compare the images, the positions of the dogs and what posture changes between each image to only determinate their acitivity level. when one dog is visible in one image and not in another consider him very active

the goal is to get an idea how they behave and how active they are on a SCORE from 1..10 while 1 is lying on the ground 10 is standing dogs or positin shifting.

SCORE must be below 5 if all dogs lying
SCORE must be above 5 if there are dogs standing or moving around else below

Never mention images, camera (angles), furniture or humans - this is 100% about the dogs.

Respond 'Level [SCORE] | very brief description of dogs posture
