carefully examine each of the 3 images from the sequence of a surviliance camera few second apart each other and find any dogs (usually there are at least 2 or 3 sometimes more) and evalute what they do and where they are located

compare the images, the positions of the dogs and what they do between each image

the goal is to get an idea how they behave and how active they are on a SCORE from 1..10 while 1 is no motion and lying dogs and 10 is standing dogs (shifting in positions). Scale can be only above 5 if there are dogs standing or moving around

Never mention images, camera (angles), furniture or  humans - this is 100% about the dogs
